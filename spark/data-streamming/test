Structural view of a coronavirus

Symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[1]
A coronavirus disease (COVID; /ˈkoʊvɪd, ˈkɒvɪd/),[2][3][4] coronavirus respiratory syndrome, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus flu, or any other variant, is a disease caused by members of the coronavirus (CoV) family.

Coronaviruses cause different coronavirus diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),[5] and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[6] Some strains of coronaviruses can also cause the common cold.[7][8][9][10]

The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak, caused by COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.[11] Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in many countries across all six WHO regions.[12] COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.[6]

Coronavirus diseases
COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.[22]

SARS
Main article: Severe acute respiratory syndrome
In 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), led to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. More than 8,000 people from 29 different countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died.[23]

MERS
Main article: Middle East respiratory syndrome
In 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing Middle East respiratory syndrome, was identified.[24]

MERS-CoV is responsible for the 2012 MERS outbreak, primarily in the Middle East, the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea and the 2018 MERS outbreak primarily in Saudi Arabia.

COVID-19
Main article: Coronavirus disease 2019
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which in December 2019 led to a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, which developed into the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coronaviruses
Main article: Coronavirus
Coronaviruses are viruses which cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans the viruses cause mild to lethal respiratory tract infections.[7]

Six species of human coronaviruses are known; four are among those that cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1.[7][8][9][25] Two additional species cause more severe symptoms and may be lethal: MERS-CoV and two different strains of SARS coronaviruses: SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.[23][26]
